### Numerai Pipeline ##

**Important: record which feature set is being used at all stages through the pipeline**

--- Feature Generation ---
- Generate new features from standard features
- Save multiple version in pickle files (with description)

--- Feature Selection ---
- Find most important features from the pickle files

--- 1. Clfs blended together (no NN) ---
-A. Take both individual clf preds and blended clf preds (save df)
-B. Feed blended preds to - 1. one classifier, save preds
                          - 2. multiple clfs then repeat step A & B

--- 2. DPP models (4 or 5 of them) ---
- Blend each model over multiple iterations

--- 3. CV calculation ---
- For 1 and 2 calculate logloss on validation set

--- 4. Weighted blend ---
- Create weights based of performance in 3 and linearly blend 1 and 2 (all predictions)
